# Weather-Dashboard

## Deployed Application : [click me](https://adilh621.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/.)

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions. Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## Process:

I went about this challenge , by making two ajax calls following a click event listener for the search button. The API returns daily forecast for the first ajax call and then 5 day forecast in the second. I went about gathering the data from the object recieved from each API call and placed them in their respected containers.


## Challenges:

Going about this project I had the most difficulty with the local storage. I hope to have that functionality up and running shortly.
